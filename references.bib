abstract="The news which is specially created to misguide as well as mislead the readers is termed fake news. Fake news can cause potential harm to both the individual and society. The problem of fake news has increased far more quickly in recent years. Social networks have significantly changed the scope and effect of their overall influence. Daily, a huge amount of information is released in print and online media, but it can be difficult to determine if the information is accurate or not. A significant amount of study has been done in this area in recent years with positive outcomes. In this modern era, machine learning is the answer to every issue. It can provide answers that people cannot readily think of and is applied in practically all disciplines, domains, and research. Many different algorithms in machine learning and artificial intelligence can help us in identifying as well as eliminating fake or false news. In this article, supervised learning is used. To determine the false news, the authors have used four machine learning algorithms in this study: Decision Tree (DT) classification, Logistic Regression (LR), Random forest (RF) and Passive Aggressive classifier (PAC). After comparing the output of each method, the one with the best accuracy is selected. The PAC outperforms the other classifiers and produces the best result.",

	abstract = {This paper contributes to the efforts of understanding the fight against fake news anddisinformation in the Philippine context, trolling propaganda machinery, and handling andeliminating trolls on social media platforms. Fake news is a false, fabricated piece of informationin the form of mainstream media. Meanwhile, disinformation is intentionally false information toharm people. Our country participates in the waves of disinformation that weeps the world,actively spreading fake news and reinforced by political trolls. On the other hand, Trolls are thespreader, sometimes the creator of disinformation in the Philippine public sphere. Trolls intend toembalm the name of the candidate they work for while reeking the rival’s name. With the recentincrease of troll armies, the Philippines might go neck-deep in disinformation and fake news.Also, this paper will discuss the participation of trolls in the recent elections and the currentstatus of the fight against trolls and fake news. This paper looks at every possible way to fighttrolls that carry fake news and disinformation disease. This will include different solutions andmethods to engage with the trolls through eradicating them properly. In conclusion, this paperbelieves that fake news and disinformation meddle with our daily life and behavior towardothers. It eventually changes the principles and ethics of those who believe fake news anddisinformation escalated by the trolls. },

abstract="In recent years, misinformation which includes false news (FN) has become a worldwide issue owing to its exponential development, mostly on social media (SM). The broad dissemination of misinformation and FN can create harmful societal repercussions. Despite current improvements, spotting fake news remains difficult owing to its intricacy, multiplicity, multi-modality, and fact-scrutiny or annotation expenses. Therefore, there is a necessity for Computational Intelligence Approaches (CIA) that can identify this fake news automatically. This study projected using dimensionality reduction (DR) approach to decrease the dimensionality of the feature vectors before sending them to the classifiers. The study focuses on a computational intelligence-based fake news detection system and a novel approach of employing three CIA for the detection of FN was proposed. The CIA employed for this study are Genetic Algorithm (GA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Bagged Ensembled Learning (BEL). The proposed system performance was evaluated utilizing confusion matrix measures like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f-measure. The system was compared with the existing system and it was deduced that the projected system outperformed that of existing systems with an accuracy of 99.28{\%}, sensitivity of 99.28{\%}, precision of 99.99{\%}, and f-measure of 99.63{\%}. In conclusion, it was discovered that GA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}KNN performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f-measure sur-passed that of the GA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}BEL.",

	abstract = {The  availability  and expansion of  social media has made it  difficult to distinguish between fake and real news. Information falsification has exponentially increased as a result of how simple it is to spread information through sharing. Social media dependability is also under jeopardy due to the extensive dissemination of false information. Therefore, it has become a research problem to automatically validate information, specifically source, content, and publisher, to identify it as true or false. Despite its limitations, machine learning (ML) has been crucial in the categorization of information. Previous studies suggested three-step methods for categorising false information on social media. In the first step of the process, the data set is subjected to a number of pre-processing processes in order to transform unstructured data sets into structured data sets. The unknowable properties of fake news and the features are extracted by the Lexicon Model in the second stage. In the third stage of this research project, a feature selection method by WOA (Whale Optimization Algorithm) for weight value to tune the classification part. Finally, a Hybrid Classification model that is hybrid with a fuzzy based Convolutional Neural Network and kernel based support vector machine is constructed in order to identify the data pertaining to bogus news. However using single classifier for fake news detection produces the insufficient accuracy. To overcome this issue in this work introduced an improved model for fake news classification. To turn unstructured data sets into structured data sets, a variety of pre-processing operations are used on the data set in the initial phase of the procedure. The unknowable properties of fake news and the features are extracted by the Lexicon Model in the second stage. In the third stage of this research project, a feature selection method by COA (Coati Optimization Algorithm) for weight value to tune the classification part. Finally, an ensemble of RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), VGG-16 and ResNet50.A classification model was developed to recognise bogus news information. Evaluate each fake news analysis' performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The suggested model, out of all the methodologies taken into consideration in this study, provides the highest outcomes, according to experimental findings},

	abstract = {From the last few years, the use of social media has increased resulting into the rise of fake news and their spreading on a large scale. Recent political events have increased the spread of fake news. As seen by the widespread impact of the huge beginning of fake news, people are inconsistent in the absence of effective fake news detectors. This work has made an attempt to automate the fake news detection process by employing the logistic regression (LR) and latest and modified word embedding technique. In this paper, we worked on the fake news recognition mechanism for 2 different datasets, viz. dataset comprising online traditional news articles and news collected from a wide range of sources. The results are compared with long short-term memory (LSTM) and traditional machine and deep learning methods for both the datasets. It reveals that the traditional mechanism for attention does not function as expected. With the help of word2vec embedding, we modified the original attention mechanism, which is more effective in dealing with this issue. The proposed method is compared with several outstanding approaches and the results are presented. Our work outperforms these methods in many parameters. This approach has created a framework that captures various fake news indicators and classifies the news as genuine or fake and makes decisions.},

abstract = {Fake news is a topic that has been discussed for quite some time. Prior to the internet era, it was mostly distributed through yellow journalism, with a focus on sensational news such as crime, rumours, accidents, and amusing news. To rescue the life of people from these fake news propagation, detection of fake news at an early stage becomes the most crucial step. People unknowingly propagate fake news and become a part of fake news propagation. While the original fake news propagators are the one with their aim to target innocent people for spreading the fake news. To stop this series of events, fake news detection and its pattern of propagation becomes very essential to society and the government. Various techniques exist to detect fake news in social media, among which neural networks have shown effective results. For this research, a deep learning based approach has been used to differentiate false news from the original ones. A LSTM neural network has been used to build the proposed model. Besides the neural network, a gloVe word embedding has been used for vector representation of textual words. Also, for feature extraction or vectorization, tokenization technique has been used. N-grams concept is used to enhance the proposed model. The comparative analysis of multiple fake news detection techniques is analysed. The results of proposed model have been evaluated using accuracy metrics. The model outperformed by achieving 99.88% of accuracy.}
